# AirBnB Clone Project 
## Requirements
* Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
* All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using `python3` (version 3.4.3)
* All your files should end with a new line
* The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
* A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
* Your code should use the `PEP 8` style (version 1.7 or more)
* All your files must be executable
* The length of your files will be tested using `wc`
* All your modules should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`)
* All your classes should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'`)
* All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'`
and `python3 -c` `'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'`)

## Python Unit Tests
* Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
* All your files should end with a new line
* All your test files should be inside a folder tests
* You have to use the [unittest module](https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/unittest.html#module-unittest)
* All your test files should be python files (extension: `.py`)
* All your test files and folders should start by `test_`
* Your file organization in the tests folder should be the same as your project
* e.g., For models/base_model.py, unit tests must be in: `tests/test_models/test_base_model.py`
* e.g., For models/user.py, unit tests must be in: `tests/test_models/test_user.py`
* All your tests should be executed by using this command: `python3 -m unittest discover tests`
* You can also test file by file by using this command: `python3 -m unittest tests/test_models/test_base_model.py`
* All your modules should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`)
* All your classes should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'`)
* All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'` 
and `python3 -c` `'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'`)
* We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases, so that you dont miss any edge case

## The command interpreter
A command interpreter is the part of a computer operating system that understands and executes commands that are entered interactively 
by a human being or from a program.

## The Console
The console is a command line interpreter that permits management of the backend of HolbertonBnB.
It can be used to handle and manipulate all classes utilized by the application (achieved by calls on the storage object)

## Console Commands
* Create
* Show
* Destroy
* All
* Count
* Update
